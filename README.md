# TreeDiameterEstimation-via-HCA

About: 

Estimate simultaneously the diameters of a large number of tree cross-sections (plot-stand level)

This project contains two files. 
- The first file (Circle Fit) contains the function: For this example I used the Val Schmidt circle fit method (source: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36361-circle_fit). 
You can use any other circle fit method, all you have to do is to call it properly in the second file.

- The second file (HCA) contains the main script.

Use: Upload your x,y (point cloud). These are the locations of the cross sections that you can extract using my application (https://github.com/panagdim/PCCrossSectionExtraction)
